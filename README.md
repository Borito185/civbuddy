# CivBuddy

Welcome to the CivBuddy mod. Originally forked from [veinbuddy](https://github.com/sbobicus/veinbuddy).
This mod is developed for making life on the CivMC minecraft server a bit easier. 
For now, it mostly focuses on features for vein mining. 
But in the future it will likely expand with features for /dest and more.
